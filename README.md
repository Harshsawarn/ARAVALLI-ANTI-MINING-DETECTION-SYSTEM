🛰️ Satellite Guard
AI-Powered Environmental Surveillance for Illegal Mining Detection

Satellite Guard is an AI-driven geospatial monitoring system designed to detect and report illegal mining activity in protected regions such as the Aravali Range.
The project focuses on environmental justice, satellite intelligence, and automated enforcement by transforming land-use change into actionable legal evidence.

🌍 Background & Problem

Illegal mining continues across parts of Haryana and Rajasthan despite strict bans issued by the Supreme Court of India.
Current enforcement relies on manual inspections, delayed satellite reviews, and field surveys, which are:

Slow and resource-intensive

Unsafe for inspectors

Prone to corruption and data gaps

As a result, environmental damage is often detected only after it becomes irreversible.

🚀 Project Overview

Satellite Guard acts as a 24×7 AI sentinel that monitors high-risk zones near the Aravali belt using geospatial intelligence.
It identifies illegal excavation activity, estimates environmental impact, and generates court-ready compliance reports.

Core Features

AI-based detection of illegal mining pits

Estimation of excavation volume and land degradation

Automated environmental penalty calculation

One-click export of legal PDF violation reports

🧠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Resium, CesiumJS (3D Geospatial Visualization)

Backend: FastAPI, Geopy (Location Intelligence)

AI Layer: Proximity-based hotspot detection & mining simulation

Reporting: jsPDF (Automated legal documentation)

🔁 Application Workflow
